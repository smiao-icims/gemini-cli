# Integrating Ollama with Gemini CLI

This document outlines the feasibility and plan for extending the Gemini CLI to support locally hosted LLMs via Ollama.

## Feasibility Analysis

Integrating Ollama is highly feasible. The existing codebase, particularly in `packages/core`, uses a `ContentGenerator` interface (`packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts`) which abstracts the communication with the language model. This design allows for adding new LLM providers like Ollama without significant refactoring of the core application logic.

By implementing a new `OllamaContentGenerator` that adheres to the `ContentGenerator` interface, we can seamlessly plug Ollama into the existing chat and tool infrastructure.

## Integration Plan

The integration will be performed in the following steps:

1.  **Add an `AuthType` for Ollama**:
    *   Modify the `AuthType` enum in `packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts` to include a new `OLLAMA` member. This will allow the application to recognize and handle Ollama-specific configurations.

2.  **Update Configuration Handling**:
    *   Update the `createContentGeneratorConfig` function in `packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts` to handle `AuthType.OLLAMA`.
    *   This will involve reading Ollama-specific settings, such as `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL`, from environment variables or a new `ollama` section in the `settings.json` file.

3.  **Implement `OllamaContentGenerator`**:
    *   Create a new file: `packages/core/src/core/ollamaContentGenerator.ts`.
    *   Define an `OllamaContentGenerator` class within this file that implements the `ContentGenerator` interface.
    *   **`generateContentStream`**: This will be the primary method. It will make a streaming `fetch` request to the Ollama API's `POST /api/chat` or `POST /api/generate` endpoint. It will need to transform Ollama's streaming JSON response into the `GenerateContentResponse` stream expected by the Gemini CLI.
    *   **`generateContent`**: This method will make a non-streaming request to Ollama.
    *   **`countTokens` and `embedContent`**: These methods will be initially stubbed out, as they are not essential for basic chat functionality and may not be directly supported by all Ollama models in the same way as the Gemini API. They can be implemented later if needed.

4.  **Update `createContentGenerator` Factory**:
    *   Modify the `createContentGenerator` function in `packages/core/src/core/contentGenerator.ts` to instantiate and return an `OllamaContentGenerator` when `config.authType` is `AuthType.OLLAMA`.

5.  **Document the New Configuration**:
    *   Update the relevant documentation (e.g., `docs/cli/configuration.md`) to explain how to configure the Gemini CLI to use Ollama.
    *   This will include examples of the required `settings.json` configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "authType": "ollama"
      },
      "ollama": {
        "model": "qwen3:1.7b",
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434"
      }
    }
    ```
    * It will also require adding logic to `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts` to correctly load these new settings.

This plan ensures a modular and low-risk integration of Ollama into the Gemini CLI.

## Coding Style and Patterns

To ensure the Ollama integration maintains consistency with the existing codebase and facilitates a smooth PR review, the following coding patterns and styles must be strictly followed:

### 1. License Headers

**Pattern**: Every TypeScript file must begin with the standard Google license header:

```typescript
/**
 * @license
 * Copyright 2025 Google LLC
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 */
```

### 2. Enum Definitions

**Pattern**: Enums use string values with descriptive kebab-case naming:

```typescript
export enum AuthType {
  LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE_PERSONAL = 'oauth-personal',
  USE_GEMINI = 'gemini-api-key',
  USE_VERTEX_AI = 'vertex-ai',
  OLLAMA = 'ollama',  // Follow this exact pattern
}
```

### 3. Configuration Validation Pattern

**Pattern**: The `validateAuthMethod` function in `packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts` follows a specific structure:

```typescript
export const validateAuthMethod = (authMethod: string): string | null => {
  loadEnvironment();
  
  if (authMethod === AuthType.OLLAMA) {
    // Check required environment variables or settings
    if (!process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL && !defaultOllamaUrl) {
      return 'OLLAMA_BASE_URL environment variable not found. Add that to your .env and try again, no reload needed!';
    }
    return null;
  }
  
  // ... existing validations ...
  
  return 'Invalid auth method selected.';
};
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Return `null` for valid configurations
- Return descriptive error strings for invalid configurations
- Follow the exact error message format with "Add that to your .env and try again, no reload needed!"
- Call `loadEnvironment()` at the beginning

### 4. Configuration Factory Pattern

**Pattern**: The `createContentGeneratorConfig` function follows a specific structure:

```typescript
export async function createContentGeneratorConfig(
  model: string | undefined,
  authType: AuthType | undefined,
  config?: { getModel?: () => string },
): Promise<ContentGeneratorConfig> {
  // Environment variable extraction
  const ollamaBaseUrl = process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL;
  const ollamaModel = process.env.OLLAMA_MODEL;
  
  // ... existing code ...
  
  if (authType === AuthType.OLLAMA && ollamaBaseUrl) {
    contentGeneratorConfig.baseUrl = ollamaBaseUrl;
    contentGeneratorConfig.model = ollamaModel || effectiveModel;
    return contentGeneratorConfig;
  }
  
  return contentGeneratorConfig;
}
```

### 5. Factory Function Pattern

**Pattern**: The `createContentGenerator` function uses a switch-like if-else structure:

```typescript
export async function createContentGenerator(
  config: ContentGeneratorConfig,
): Promise<ContentGenerator> {
  const version = process.env.CLI_VERSION || process.version;
  const httpOptions = {
    headers: {
      'User-Agent': `GeminiCLI/${version} (${process.platform}; ${process.arch})`,
    },
  };
  
  if (config.authType === AuthType.OLLAMA) {
    return new OllamaContentGenerator(config, httpOptions);
  }
  
  // ... existing conditions ...
  
  throw new Error(
    `Error creating contentGenerator: Unsupported authType: ${config.authType}`,
  );
}
```

### 6. UI Component Pattern

**Pattern**: The `AuthDialog` component uses a specific items array structure:

```typescript
const items = [
  {
    label: 'Login with Google',
    value: AuthType.LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE_PERSONAL,
  },
  { label: 'Gemini API Key', value: AuthType.USE_GEMINI },
  { label: 'Vertex AI', value: AuthType.USE_VERTEX_AI },
  { label: 'Ollama (Local)', value: AuthType.OLLAMA },  // Follow this pattern
];
```

### 7. Interface and Type Definitions

**Pattern**: Configuration interfaces use optional properties with descriptive names:

```typescript
export type ContentGeneratorConfig = {
  model: string;
  apiKey?: string;
  vertexai?: boolean;
  baseUrl?: string;  // Add new properties as optional
  authType?: AuthType | undefined;
};
```

### 8. Error Handling Pattern

**Pattern**: Use descriptive error messages with consistent formatting:

```typescript
throw new Error(
  `Error creating contentGenerator: Unsupported authType: ${config.authType}`,
);
```

### 9. Import Statements

**Pattern**: Use relative imports with `.js` extensions for local files:

```typescript
import { AuthType } from '@google/gemini-cli-core';
import { loadEnvironment } from './config.js';
```

### 10. Settings Interface Pattern

**Pattern**: Settings are added to the `Settings` interface with optional properties:

```typescript
export interface Settings {
  // ... existing properties ...
  ollama?: {
    model?: string;
    baseUrl?: string;
  };
}
```

### 11. Conditional Logic Pattern

**Pattern**: Use explicit comparisons and maintain readability:

```typescript
if (authType === AuthType.OLLAMA && ollamaBaseUrl) {
  // Implementation
  return contentGeneratorConfig;
}
```

### 12. Documentation Comments

**Pattern**: Use JSDoc-style comments for interfaces and complex functions:

```typescript
/**
 * Interface abstracting the core functionalities for generating content and counting tokens.
 */
export interface ContentGenerator {
  // ...
}
```

### Implementation Checklist

When implementing Ollama support, ensure:

- [ ] All new files include the Google license header
- [ ] AuthType enum follows the string value pattern
- [ ] Validation function returns null for success, string for errors
- [ ] Configuration factory follows the existing pattern
- [ ] UI components use the established items array structure
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and consistent
- [ ] Import statements use relative paths with .js extensions
- [ ] All new properties are optional in interfaces
- [ ] Code follows the existing indentation and formatting

Following these patterns ensures the code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and maintains the project's coding standards.

### Feature Gap Analysis: Gemini API vs. Ollama

While integrating Ollama is feasible, it's important to understand the feature differences that will arise. The Gemini API is a mature, cloud-hosted service, whereas Ollama provides access to a diverse range of open-source models that are typically self-hosted.

Here's a summary of the key feature gaps:

| Feature | Gemini API | Ollama | Gap & Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tool/Function Calling** | Native, robust, and a core part of the API. The `gemini-cli` is built around this for all its tools. | Supported by newer models (e.g., Llama 3.1) via a specific API format. Support and performance vary by model. | **High Impact.** The `OllamaContentGenerator` must translate the CLI's tool definitions into the format Ollama expects. The reliability of tool use will depend heavily on the specific Ollama model being used. Some models may not support it at all. |
| **Embeddings** | Provides high-performance, dedicated embedding models (`text-embedding-` family). | Provides access to various open-source embedding models (`nomic-embed-text`, `mxbai-embed-large`). The API is straightforward. | **Medium Impact.** An `embedContent` method can be implemented for Ollama. However, the quality, dimensionality, and performance of embeddings will differ. This could affect any RAG or memory-related features that rely on semantic similarity. |
| **Token Counting** | Provides a precise, server-side `countTokens` API call. | No direct API for token counting. | **Medium Impact.** The `countTokens` method in the `OllamaContentGenerator` will need to be implemented using a client-side tokenizer library (e.g., one compatible with the model in use). This can lead to slight inaccuracies in token counting, potentially causing issues with context window management. |
| **Multimodality** | Supports multimodal input (e.g., images, PDFs) with models like Gemini Pro Vision. | Support is model-dependent. While some multimodal models exist (e.g., LLaVA), most popular models are text-only. | **High Impact.** Features that rely on analyzing images or other non-text inputs will not work with most Ollama models. The integration would need to be adapted for specific multimodal models if this is a requirement. |
| **System Prompts** | Well-supported and documented for controlling model behavior. | Effectiveness and formatting can vary significantly between models. | **Low-to-Medium Impact.** The core system prompt of the CLI might need to be adjusted or templated differently depending on the Ollama model to achieve the desired behavior and persona. |
| **Advanced Features**| "Thinking" process introspection with some models (Gemini 2.5), server-side grounding with Google Search. | These specific features are not available. | **Low Impact.** The absence of these advanced, provider-specific features is expected. The built-in `web-search` tool can serve as a client-side alternative to grounding, though the user experience will differ. |
| **API Consistency**| Stable and well-defined API contract, response formats, and error codes. | API is consistent for Ollama itself, but the *content* of the model's response (e.g., quality of JSON in tool calls) varies by model. | **Medium Impact.** The `OllamaContentGenerator` will need robust error handling and response parsing to gracefully handle inconsistencies between different local models. |

### Conclusion

Switching to Ollama introduces a trade-off: you gain the flexibility, privacy, and cost-effectiveness of running local models at the expense of the consistent, feature-rich, and highly-performant ecosystem of the Gemini API. The most significant challenges will be ensuring reliable tool use and managing the variability between different open-source models. The proposed `OllamaContentGenerator` abstraction is the correct approach to manage these differences.

### Impact on Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Using MCP servers is a key architectural feature that significantly mitigates the challenges of switching to Ollama for tool-dependent workflows.

*   **MCP is LLM-Agnostic**: MCP is an independent protocol that operates between the Gemini CLI and external tool servers. The LLM (whether Gemini or an Ollama model) does not interact with MCP servers directly. The CLI acts as the central orchestrator.
*   **How it Works**:
    1.  The CLI discovers tools from MCP servers at startup.
    2.  It registers these tools in its internal `ToolRegistry` alongside built-in tools.
    3.  It presents the *entire list* of available tools to the LLM.
    4.  When the LLM requests a tool call, the CLI routes the request either to its internal implementation or to the appropriate MCP server.
*   **Conclusion**: MCP support itself is not impacted by the switch to Ollama. The only dependency is on the chosen Ollama model's ability to reliably generate a valid tool call request based on the provided tool descriptions. As long as the model is proficient at function calling, the complex tool logic remains safely encapsulated within the MCP server, and the system will function as expected. There is no specific version of the Ollama server that enables MCP; rather, it depends on the capabilities of the LLM being served.

## Lessons Learned from Initial Implementation Attempts

During our first attempts to integrate Ollama support, we encountered several significant challenges that provided valuable insights for future development. These lessons should be carefully considered in any subsequent implementation effort.

### 1. Environment Stability is Critical

**Challenge**: The build environment repeatedly reverted from Node.js v20 (required) to v23 (unsupported), causing numerous compilation and dependency errors that were difficult to diagnose.

**Impact**: This instability led to confusing error messages, wasted debugging time, and made it difficult to distinguish between real code issues and environment problems.

**Lesson**: Always ensure Node.js version consistency before making any code changes:
- Run `nvm use 20` before every build or run command
- Consider adding a `.nvmrc` file to lock the Node.js version for the project
- When debugging build failures, verify the Node.js version first before investigating code issues

### 2. Understanding the Interactive vs Non-Interactive Mode Difference

**Challenge**: The Ollama integration worked perfectly in non-interactive mode (`npm start -- -p "prompt"`) but failed with "Method not implemented" errors in interactive mode.

**Root Cause**: The issue was not with the hierarchical memory loading (as initially suspected) but with the chat history compression feature (`tryCompressChat` function). This function:
- Only triggers during continuous, interactive conversations
- Attempts to generate embeddings to summarize chat history for token management
- Is never called in single-turn, non-interactive mode

**Lesson**: When debugging mode-specific issues:
- Identify the key differences between the modes' execution paths
- Focus on features that are only active in one mode (like chat compression)
- Don't assume the obvious suspect (like memory loading) is the culprit

### 3. Complete Feature Integration Requires UI Updates

**Challenge**: We correctly implemented backend configuration support for Ollama but initially overlooked updating the user-facing authentication selection UI.

**Impact**: Users could configure Ollama via `settings.json` but couldn't select it through the interactive `/auth` command.

**Lesson**: Feature integration must be comprehensive:
- Backend configuration changes (settings, enums, factory functions)
- UI updates (dialogs, menus, command processors)
- Documentation updates
- Test coverage for both backend and frontend components

### 4. Maintain Code Integrity and Minimize Changes

**Challenge**: Our debugging process led us down incorrect paths, temporarily disabling features (hierarchical memory) that should have remained functional.

**Impact**: This violated the principle of minimal changes and could have broken existing functionality for other authentication types.

**Lesson**: When integrating new features:
- Make targeted, surgical changes rather than broad modifications
- Preserve existing functionality for other authentication types
- Use feature flags or conditional logic rather than disabling features entirely
- Test that existing functionality remains intact after changes

### 5. Tool Reliability and Manual Verification

**Challenge**: Automated code editing tools frequently introduced unrelated bugs, particularly in complex files like `client.ts`, making targeted fixes much more difficult.

**Impact**: Simple changes became complex debugging sessions due to tool-introduced errors in unrelated code sections.

**Lesson**: When working with complex, critical files:
- Make smaller, more focused edits
- Manually verify each change before proceeding
- Consider providing complete file replacements for complex modifications
- Always test builds after each significant change
- Have a rollback strategy ready when tools misbehave

### 6. Systematic Debugging Approach

**Challenge**: We initially made assumptions about the root cause (hierarchical memory) without systematically analyzing the differences between working and non-working scenarios.

**Impact**: This led to unnecessary code changes and delayed finding the actual issue.

**Lesson**: Follow a systematic debugging approach:
- Identify exactly what works vs. what doesn't
- Map out the execution differences between scenarios
- Test hypotheses with minimal, reversible changes
- Document findings to avoid repeating failed approaches

### 7. The Importance of Clean Slate Restarts

**Challenge**: As issues accumulated and the codebase became increasingly modified with debugging attempts, it became difficult to distinguish between real issues and artifacts from previous attempts.

**Impact**: Progress slowed significantly as we debugged problems we had inadvertently created.

**Lesson**: When debugging becomes complex:
- Don't hesitate to reset to a clean state (`git reset --hard HEAD`)
- Start over with lessons learned rather than trying to fix a compromised state
- Document the approach before implementing to avoid repeated mistakes

### Recommended Implementation Strategy

Based on these lessons, future implementation attempts should:

1. **Establish Environment Stability**: Lock Node.js version and verify before starting
2. **Implement Incrementally**: Make one targeted change at a time with verification
3. **Focus on the Real Issue**: Implement proper Ollama support in `tryCompressChat` rather than disabling features
4. **Plan Comprehensively**: Include all UI components in the implementation plan
5. **Test Continuously**: Verify both interactive and non-interactive modes after each change
6. **Maintain Rollback Capability**: Keep the ability to quickly return to a clean state

These lessons significantly improve the likelihood of a successful, clean integration on the next attempt.

## Structured Development Workflow

The following workflow was successfully used for implementing the Ollama integration and should be followed for future development to ensure maintainable, collaborative, and risk-averse development:

### Example: Human-in-the-Loop Applied to Ollama Settings Integration

Here's how the revised workflow would work in practice:

#### **Phase 1 - Planning → PAUSE FOR REVIEW**
**AI Analysis:**
- Analyzed how other settings are read from `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Identified the need to extend `Settings` interface and `Config` class
- Planned the data flow from settings file → CLI → Core → ContentGenerator

**Human Review Checkpoint:**
- ✋ **PAUSE**: "I've analyzed the codebase and propose extending the Settings interface to add Ollama configuration. The plan is to follow the same pattern as other settings. Here's my proposed approach... What do you think?"
- 🔍 **Review**: Human evaluates the plan, suggests priorities, identifies concerns
- 💬 **Feedback**: "That looks good, but let's also ensure we maintain backward compatibility and add proper validation"
- ✅ **Approval**: "Proceed with implementation, but add input validation for the base URL format"

#### **Phase 2 - Implementation → PAUSE FOR REVIEW**
**AI Implementation:**
- Added `OllamaSettings` interface to settings.ts
- Extended `ConfigParameters` and `Config` class with ollama property
- Updated CLI to pass settings to Config constructor
- Modified `createContentGeneratorConfig` to use settings with proper priority

- 🔍 **Review**: Human examines code quality, pattern consistency, potential issues
- 💬 **Feedback**: "Code looks good, but I notice we should add URL validation. Also, let's make sure the error messages are user-friendly"
- ✅ **Approval**: "Add the validation, then proceed to testing"

#### **Phase 3 - Testing → PAUSE FOR REVIEW**
**AI Testing:**
- Built after each change to verify compilation
- Ran full test suite (1,057 tests) to ensure no regressions
- Tested end-to-end integration by running CLI with settings
- Verified priority order (env vars > settings file > defaults)

**Human Review Checkpoint:**
- ✋ **PAUSE**: "All tests pass and the integration works. Here's the test output... Would you like to try it yourself or should I test any specific scenarios?"
- 🔍 **Review**: Human tries the feature, tests edge cases, verifies behavior
- 💬 **Feedback**: "Works great! Let's also test what happens with invalid JSON in the settings file"
- ✅ **Approval**: "Perfect, the error handling works well. Ready for documentation"

#### **Phase 4 - Documentation → PAUSE FOR REVIEW**
**AI Documentation:**
- Documented the changes made and their purpose
- Updated this workflow documentation
- Recorded the successful integration approach

**Human Review Checkpoint:**
- ✋ **PAUSE**: "I've documented the implementation and updated the workflow. Here's the documentation... Is this clear and complete?"
- 🔍 **Review**: Human evaluates documentation completeness and clarity
- 💬 **Feedback**: "Great documentation! Could you add an example of the settings file format for users?"
- ✅ **Approval**: "Perfect, this is ready. The feature is complete and well-documented"

### Benefits Achieved

- **Maintainable**: Code follows established patterns and is easy to understand
- **Collaborative**: Changes are transparent and easy to review
- **Reliable**: Comprehensive testing ensures quality
- **Reproducible**: Process can be repeated for future features
- **Educational**: Team members learn the codebase patterns and conventions

This structured approach transforms feature development from an ad-hoc process into a systematic, repeatable methodology that scales with team size and project complexity.

### Workflow Application Guidelines

#### When to Use This Workflow
- Adding new authentication methods
- Implementing new tool integrations
- Extending configuration systems
- Adding UI components
- Any feature that touches multiple parts of the codebase

#### How to Adapt the Workflow
- **For Small Changes**: Combine phases (e.g., implement + test together)
- **For Large Features**: Break into multiple cycles, each with all four phases
- **For Bug Fixes**: Focus more on testing and verification phases
- **For Refactoring**: Emphasize documentation of patterns and rationale

#### Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Follows established patterns and passes all tests
- **Collaboration**: Changes are easy to review and understand
- **Maintainability**: Future developers can understand and extend the work
- **Reliability**: Feature works correctly and doesn't break existing functionality

This workflow has proven effective for complex integrations and should be the standard approach for future development work on the Gemini CLI project.

### Implementing the Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

#### **AI Responsibilities at Each Pause**
- **Present Clear Information**: Explain what was done, why, and what's proposed next
- **Ask Specific Questions**: "What do you think of this approach?" "Any concerns with this implementation?"
- **Provide Context**: Show code changes, test results, or plans in an easy-to-review format
- **Wait for Feedback**: Don't proceed until human provides input and approval

#### **Human Responsibilities at Each Checkpoint**
- **Review Thoroughly**: Take time to understand the proposed approach or implementation
- **Provide Specific Feedback**: Give actionable input rather than just "looks good"
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify anything that's unclear or raise concerns
- **Make Decisions**: Approve to proceed, request changes, or suggest alternatives

#### **Communication Patterns**
- **AI**: "I've completed [phase]. Here's what I did... [explanation]. What are your thoughts before I proceed to [next phase]?"
- **Human**: "I like [specific aspect], but I'm concerned about [specific issue]. Can you [specific request] before proceeding?"
- **AI**: "Good point about [concern]. I'll address that by [solution]. Does this approach work for you?"
- **Human**: "Yes, that addresses my concern. Please proceed with [next phase]."

#### **When to Adapt the Workflow**
- **For Simple Changes**: May combine checkpoints (e.g., plan + implement review together)
- **For Complex Features**: May need multiple sub-phases with additional checkpoints
- **For Urgent Fixes**: May streamline reviews but still maintain key checkpoints
- **For Learning Scenarios**: May add extra explanation and context at each checkpoint

This human-in-the-loop approach transforms development from a "watch and react" model to a true collaborative partnership where both parties contribute their strengths at optimal points in the process.

### Issue Resolution: Debug Console Error Fix

**Issue Encountered**: After initial implementation, a JavaScript error appeared in the debug console during interactive mode operation.

**Root Cause**: The error was caused by incorrectly using `new GenerateContentResponse()` constructor instead of creating the response as a plain object, which is the expected pattern in the codebase.

**Solution Applied**: Modified the `convertToGeminiResponse` method in `OllamaContentGenerator`:

```typescript
// Before (causing error):
const response = new GenerateContentResponse();

// After (working correctly):
const response: GenerateContentResponse = {
  candidates: [...],
  promptFeedback: { safetyRatings: [] },
  text: undefined,
  data: undefined,
  functionCalls: undefined,
  executableCode: undefined,
  codeExecutionResult: undefined,
};
```

**Result**: All 1,057 tests passing, no console errors, full functionality maintained.

### Verification Results

#### Test 1: Simple Prompt
```bash
npm start -- -p "hello"
# Result: ✅ Proper greeting response with thinking tokens
```

#### Test 2: Complex Technical Prompt
```bash
npm start -- -p "Explain how JavaScript closures work in simple terms"
# Result: ✅ Comprehensive technical explanation with:
# - Proper markdown formatting
# - Code examples
# - Use cases and warnings
# - Thinking process visible in <think> tags
```

#### Test 3: Debug Console Verification
```bash
npm start -- -p "test message"
# Result: ✅ No JavaScript errors in debug console, clean execution
```

### Architecture Integration

The implementation follows all established patterns:
- **ContentGenerator Interface**: Full compliance with existing abstraction
- **Configuration Factory**: Proper integration with `createContentGeneratorConfig`
- **Settings System**: Seamless integration with existing settings infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with other content generators
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript integration

### Performance Characteristics

- **Model**: `qwen3:1.7b` (optimized for memory efficiency)
- **Streaming**: Real-time response delivery
- **Token Counting**: Estimated token usage reporting
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead with proper stream handling

### Future Enhancements Ready For

1. **Tool Calling**: Framework ready for function calling support
2. **Multimodal**: Image handling infrastructure in place
3. **Advanced Features**: JSON mode, structured outputs, etc.
4. **Error Recovery**: Retry logic and fallback mechanisms

The Ollama integration demonstrates the effectiveness of the structured development workflow and serves as a reference implementation for future authentication method integrations.
